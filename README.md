# HeatmapAnalysis

## Current State
Not functioning after splitting into standalone files.  Issue with event wiring.  Most likely needs to be moved to an init function.


## Goal

Create a tool for analyzing accounts in relation to staff location.  Determine if the current structure of sales organization is appropriate based on revenue, industry, and location.

## Solution

Take inputs from HR and Salesforce datasets and plot an account/revenue heatmap

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add filters for Employee Data, Industry, and more
- [ ] Add Charts and other Visualizations
- [ ] Refactor
